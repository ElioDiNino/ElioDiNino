<!----- About Me ----->

<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

I am a driven UBC Engineering student interested in computers and software. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing personal programming projects, cycling, playing soccer, learning about new technologies and [taking landscape photos](https://photography.eliodinino.com).

  <summary>:spiral_notepad: Read More</summary>
  
  <br/>
  
  One of my values is to always continue learning. To uphold this, I pursue projects that require me to learn new skills and I seek new experiences, often outside of my comfort zone. I also look to meet new people and challenge myself whenever I can. I believe that this continuous learning and seeking of challenges is important to my growth and adaptability.
  
  My hard-working nature and natural leadership skills make me a valuable team member who can both listen and lead if needed. Furthermore, my attention to detail and organizational skills contribute to the timely completion of high-quality deliverables. As a result of these core attributes, along with my past experiences and promising future, I was awarded full-ride scholarships to both UBC and McMaster University.

  
  ## :dart: Professional Goal
  I hope to use my current and future skills to pursue a career in the Computer Engineering field. To get there I am looking to try many different roles through co-ops and volunteering opportunities at UBC. Following this, I will seek a career that I am passionate about and one that makes a positive impact on the world.

<h2 align="center">What I'm Up To</h2>
<details>
  <summary>:card_file_box: Past Projects</summary>
  
  ### :robot: [Quote Bot](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Quote)
  This is a rehost of [nakayoshi](https://github.com/nakayoshi)'s Discord Quote bot which was taken offline in early 2022. In the process of rehosting it I updated some of the bot's commands and patched several security vulnerabilities. A few weeks after, I also completed an overhaul of the bot with slash command support, improved error-handling, thread channel support, patched [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/nakayoshi/quote/issues/5), and other improvements. Since the overhaul, the bot has been up and running for free on Google Cloud without any issues. I continue to keep the up to date with the latest Discord.js releases.
  
  ### :scroll: [SSC Scripts](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/SSC-Scripts)
  This repository is home to different scripts for pulling information off of [UBC's SSC](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/) and then notifying the specified emails of what new information is available. It uses [UBC's Webmail](https://webmail.student.ubc.ca/) so that any user with a [CWL](https://it.ubc.ca/services/accounts-passwords/campus-wide-login-cwl) can use the scripts without having to worry about what email service they use for their primary email. An example of one of these scripts is [`grades.py`](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/SSC-Scripts/blob/master/src/grades.py) which checks for when new grades are posted. It can check for multiple course grades at a time and has many other customizable options.
  
  ### :robot: [Autonomous Claw](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Autonomous-Claw)
  This is a collection of the programming work that went into the autonomous claw project for UBC's APSC 101. The goal of the project was to semi-autonomously pick up objects of different sizes and weights and transport them to a drop-off location accurately and efficiently.
  
  ### :abacus: [Harvard's CS50](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/CS50)
  This is a collection of the code I wrote for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) that I am proud of and that was of interest to me. I took part in the course during the [Spring 2021 session](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/).
  
  ### :shield: [UBC Bot](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/UBC-Bot)
  This was my friend and I's final project for CS50. It is a basic Discord moderation bot that has a mix of different commands. It is quite basic but we used it as a way to learn about Discord.js and learn the basics for future Discord bot projects.
  
  ### :pencil2: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/426417770)
  This is the Scratch project I made as part of CS50's [Week 0 tasks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/psets/0/scratch/). It is a simple but fun game with randomized music and an infinite scrolling background.
  
  ### :snake: [Python Learning](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Python-Learning)
  This is a collection of the Python code I wrote for a high school programming class where we followed the lessons and tasks from [Program Arcade Games](http://programarcadegames.com/). At the end I also did a final project exploring machine learning using the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
  
  ### :joystick: [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/143581)
  This is a site I used as part of one of my high school programming classes. It uses [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and I used it to make a couple of different games and get experience with object-oriented programming and other common programming principles.

  ### :airplane: [UBC Uncrewed Aircraft Systems](https://ubcuas.com)
  I work on the software subteam as a co-lead for UBC UAS, a design team focused on designing semi-autonomous drones. The team repositories can be seen [here](https://github.com/ubcuas). This year, my focus as co-lead is keeping projects on track and supporting the 18 software subteam members where needed. That being said, with my past experience on the team, I got to work on a variety of microsystems. Some of my notable contributions as both a developer and as co-lead are as follows:
  - Decreased microservices in use by 50% after co-designing a new software suite for 2 competitions
  - Improved cross-platform compatibility with the use of Docker to better package programs
  - Integrated a new camera system into the drone and software suite for use in machine vision
  - [GCOM-X](https://github.com/ubcuas/gcom-x): This is our main ground station control software. I helped work on the frontend redesign, updated the backend API, integrated a Django server with the React frontent, and added a login page to connect to competiton servers.
  - [ACOM](https://github.com/ubcuas/acom): Running on the drone, this is our main communication method with the ground station for the software subteam. I worked on adding support for controlling a winch system, monitoring RC connection, and keeping track of the battery usage.
  
  ### :school: UBC Course Projects
  *Code access is available upon request for all projects
  #### [Multi-Client Server](https://cpen221-ubc.notion.site/Message-Queues-Pub-Sub-with-Twitter-c5965b28ed01482aad44dbaadac19b77) - CPEN 221
  - Constructed a server supporting multiple simultaneous clients capable of interacting and fetching tweets from Twitter
  - Enabled dual-server routing so that either server can be connected to, and no interruptions occur if one goes offline
  - Followed security protocols by hashing and salting all passwords and encrypting incoming and outgoing data via AES
  
  #### Simple RISC Machine - CPEN 211
  - Implemented a Turing Complete 16-bit RISC machine using System Verilog on an FPGA board in 3 weeks
  - Subdivided the machine into smaller modules to be designed, tested, and debugged more easily
  - Utilized pipelining to increase operations per cycle by 300% and go beyond course expectations
  
  #### [Graphs, Games, and Interplanetary Travel](https://cpen221-ubc.notion.site/Graphs-Games-and-Interplanetary-Travel-79cb9a0844634b7288226639604eb0b0) - CPEN 221
  - Collaboratively built the “Kamino Game” in Java and produced the most optimal solution to win the course competition
  - Implemented graph and tree data structures with associated algorithms while optimizing time and space complexity
  - Exercised best practices including unit testing, documentation, and encapsulation to ensure quality and correctness

  ### :computer: [Personal Website](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/eliodinino.com)
  This is something I had long desired to work on. I have quite a bit of experience building websites with services such as Wix, WordPress, and Squarespace, but I didn't have much experience with actually programming a website. I used React to build my site as it has applicable skills to UAS and is something I could see myself using in the future (although I understand it is far from the best thing to use for a static website). I am happy with my current implementation but I am looking to improve it going forward.
