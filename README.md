<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

I am a driven UBC Engineering student interested in computers and software. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing personal programming projects, cycling, playing soccer, learning about new technologies and [taking landscape photos](https://photography.eliodinino.com).

<details>
  <summary>:spiral_notepad: Read More</summary>
  
  <br/>
  
  One of my values is to always continue learning. To uphold this, I pursue projects that require me to learn new skills and I seek new experiences, often outside of my comfort zone. I also look to meet new people and challenge myself whenever I can. I believe that this continuous learning and seeking of challenges is important to my growth and adaptability.
  
  My hard-working nature and natural leadership skills make me a valuable team member who can both listen and lead if needed. Furthermore, my attention to detail and organizational skills contribute to the timely completion of high-quality deliverables. As a result of these core attributes, along with my past experiences and promising future, I was awarded full-ride scholarships to both UBC and McMaster University.

  
  ## :dart: Professional Goal
  I hope to use my current and future skills to pursue a career in the Computer Engineering field. To get there I am looking to try many different roles through co-ops and volunteering opportunities at UBC. Following this, I will seek a career that I am passionate about and one that makes a positive impact on the world.

<h2 align="center">What I'm Up To</h2>
<details>
  <summary>:card_file_box: Past Projects</summary>
  
  ### :scroll: [SSC Scripts](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/SSC-Scripts)
  This repository is home to different scripts for pulling information off of [UBC's SSC](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/) and then notifying the specified emails of what new information is available. It uses [UBC's Webmail](https://webmail.student.ubc.ca/) so that any user with a [CWL](https://it.ubc.ca/services/accounts-passwords/campus-wide-login-cwl) can use the scripts without having to worry about what email service they use for their primary email. An example of one of these scripts is [`grades.py`](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/SSC-Scripts/blob/master/src/grades.py) which checks for when new grades are posted. It can check for multiple course grades at a time and has many other customizable options.
  
  ### :robot: [Autonomous Claw](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Autonomous-Claw)
  This is a collection of the programming work that went into the autonomous claw project for UBC's APSC 101. The goal of the project was to semi-autonomously pick up objects of different sizes and weights and transport them to a drop-off location accurately and efficiently.
  
  ### :abacus: [Harvard's CS50](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/CS50)
  This is a collection of the code I wrote for [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) that I am proud of and that was of interest to me. I took part in the course during the [Spring 2021 session](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/).
  
  ### :shield: [UBC Bot](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/UBC-Bot)
  This was my friend and I's final project for CS50. It is a basic Discord moderation bot that has a mix of different commands. It is quite basic but we used it as a way to learn about Discord.js and learn the basics for future Discord bot projects.
  
  ### :pencil2: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/426417770)
  This is the Scratch project I made as part of CS50's [Week 0 tasks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/psets/0/scratch/). It is a simple but fun game with randomized music and an infinite scrolling background.
  
  ### :snake: [Python Learning](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Python-Learning)
  This is a collection of the Python code I wrote for a high school programming class where we followed the lessons and tasks from [Program Arcade Games](http://programarcadegames.com/). At the end I also did a final project exploring machine learning using the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
  
  ### :joystick: [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/143581)
  This is a site I used as part of one of my high school programming classes. It uses [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and I used it to make a couple of different games and get experience with object-oriented programming and other common programming principles.

  ### :airplane: [UBC Uncrewed Aircraft Systems](https://ubcuas.com)
  I work on the software subteam for UBC UAS, a design team focused on designing semi-autonomous drones. The team repositories can be seen [here](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas) and my GitLab profile [here](https://gitlab.com/ElioDiNino). I have worked on a variety of microsystems for the team, but my notable contributions are as follows:
  - [GCOM-X](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/gcom-x): This is our main ground station control software. I have been helping work on the frontend redesign and adding new functionality for full mission control. Our in-progress branch can be seen [here](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/gcom-x/-/tree/47-gcom-overhaul) with photos in [this ongoing merge request](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/gcom-x/-/merge_requests/55).
  - [ACOM](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/acom): Running on the drone, this is our main communication with the ground station. I worked on adding support for controlling a winch system, monitoring RC connection, and keeping track of the battery usage.
  - [AAA](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/aaa): This is our repository for active aircraft avoidance that integrates with GCOM-X. I helped write it from the ground up and am working on integrating it with our other systems.
  - [Odroid Scripts](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/odroid-scripts): Our drones are all equipped with Odroids, small Linux computers that we use to load code onto and interface with the rest of the drone, including the flight controller. This repository is a collection of scripts that have been made for the Odroids. I helped work on the syncing scripts for grabbing images taken on the drone and transferring them as quickly as possible over SSH then displaying them. [The first one](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/odroid-scripts/-/blob/master/syncing.sh) I wrote at our competition in May 2022 and is a bash script that uses [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) to copy the images and then we used a separate program to display them. Following this, I made a [revised program](https://gitlab.com/ubcuas/odroid-scripts/-/blob/master/syncing.py) that combines the functionality of both and runs 3x faster.

  ### :computer: [Personal Website](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/eliodinino.com)
  This is something I have long desired to work on. I have quite a bit of experience building websites with services such as Wix, WordPress, and Squarespace, but I don't have much experience with actually programming a website. I plan on using React to build my site as it has applicable skills to UAS and is something I could see myself using in the future. I will continue to use Wix for my [photography website](https://photography.eliodinino.com) for now, but I may change that in the future.
  
  ### :robot: [Quote Bot](https://github.com/ElioDiNino/Quote)
  This is a rehost of [nakayoshi](https://github.com/nakayoshi)'s Discord Quote bot which was taken offline in early 2022. In the process of rehosting it I updated some of the bot's commands and patched several security vulnerabilities. A few weeks after, I also completed an overhaul of the bot with slash command support, improved error-handling, thread channel support, patched [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/nakayoshi/quote/issues/5), and other improvements. Since the overhaul, the bot has been up and running for free on Google Cloud without any issues.
